annoSnake, a Snakemake workflow that streamlines structural and functional annotation of metagenomes and MAGs, starting from raw sequencing reads to fully annotated metagenomes and MAGs. The user can choose between different types of input read formats (paired-end or interleaved), annotation databases (eg. Pfam, KEGG, CAZy), and output visualisations.
